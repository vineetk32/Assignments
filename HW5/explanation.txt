Input file in.txt contains 4 files. (do not hardcode in.txt in your program as name of input file)
These four files contain preprocessed data - raw words separated by whitespace - no special characters.
corpus.txt contains two words - cricket and england

cricket appears 12 times in File1, 3 times in File2, 3 times in File3 and 12 times in File4
england appears 3 times in File1, 3 times in File2, 1 time in File3 and 1 time in File4
So TF of cricket is 12+3+3+12=30 and DF of cricket is 4
TF of england is 3+3+1+1=8 and DF of england is 4 

Say you have given one file to CPU and three to GPU, you will need to merge the hash tables at the end to get TF and DF

The first part of the output will print one line for each corpus token as follows - 
corpus token text:TF:DF:

The total number of words 355+109+195+181=840
The next line should be total number of words and total number of documents.

The output will be as following - 

$ ./a3 in.txt corpus.txt
cricket:30:4:
england:8:4:
840:4:
cricket:0.035714286
england:0.00952381
