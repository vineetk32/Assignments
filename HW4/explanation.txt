Output explanation:
Outputs should be country-wise.
USA is listed first in the countries file and then India and then China.
Within USA, 2009 has most entries.
So phase-1 output will have 2009-USA then so on with decreasing number of movies per year.
Same format is followed for other countries.
India has most movis from 1999 and then from 2009 etc.

Execution Flow:
So you will read countries file, deduce that there are 3 countries.
Read all the input files and put the lines read in country-specific buffers.
You will have 3 buffers at the end.
Then, you will invoke (maybe) 15 threads (5 on each buffer)
These threads will input data in a single global hash table and will use the atomic operations for updation.
It will display the output and finally the overall top rated movies.

Note:
** Please make sure your output matches exactly with the sample output.
So country name, then colon, newline, year, colon, number of movies and then movies on newlines.
An extra newline between country outputs and the final output as well.
Please ensure your output conforms to this format. **
